**Team Project #1**  

Our team began by finding repetition to our code. We broke down repeated phrases in the song, marking each with a number to
indicate the phrase. There were 4 repeated static methods, which were delegated among members to be written. The team decided 
these methods would be named after the number assigned to them (ie. One, two, three, four). While the methods were written the
team lead wrote the main program, calling the static methods as appropriate. These methods were then posted to our team forum and 
copy and pasted into the bottom of the code. Upon compiling here, our code ran. However, Cheyenne noticed there were some more 
specific instructions, to call each verse as a method. The code was quickly edited to align with these standards by the team lead,
while Ella created a Github for our group. We hadn’t liked the CANVAS system for sharing code and wanted to alter our future 
processes for group collaboration. The final code was posted to the Team Project Github for editing and team contribution.

What the group that I am working in did was that we broke down the project and, individually worked on a smaller portion of the
project. Once everyone completed their portion, one person pieced all the code together and then we discussed if we liked the 
outcome of not. Personally, I joined the project late therefore my role was mostly understanding the inner working of the code 
and the helping creating the main method. The way we accomplished our goals is by communicating were each of us were in the 
projected and if anyone had questions we would discuss it all together.

I was the team lead for our project, and quickly set to delegating tasks. We were done quickly, and I was happy with the progress. All the team members really helped to contribute, and communication went well. I had challenges finding things for our new group member to do, as she had just started. I wasn’t sure how far along she was in the course work, so I had her follow along with me as best I could while managing the project. Everyone did a great job of speaking up and adding their strengths to the group. Most importantly, I feel we are now better prepared for a larger and more complex project together, like we will see in the future with the course work. I heavily insisted on using Github for all group project related concerns, in part because I feel it’s important to understand the platform and to make contributions. We are all very new to the experience, and learning how to make contributions to Github effectively.

I thought this project was easy to do. We worked well together as a group and were able to finish it quickly. First, I read through the song and looked for repeating lines. I noticed that the last verse of the line had repeating lines from the past verses. I labeled which lines repeated as one, two, three, and four. Then Lee gave each person in our group a repeating line to make a method for. I did the repeating line, “"I added a main method with its String[] args,”. Then I copy and pasted my part of the code into a discussion we made on our project team page on Canvas. After Lee put it all together, I helped to make sure that our solution matched the instructions given. I feel like we may have made Lee do too much of the work and we could have split it up even more efficiently. In the future, we could maybe outline what we need to do together and break it down together. Then pick parts that seem more even to code separately.

At the beginning of the project, the team leader assigned roles to each member.
We first started by organizing each person to write a method correlating to a repeating part of the song. 
Writing the code itself was easy, and if I had a question, my team members would help. After each member finished their method, we submitted it on the canvas group. 
Then it was combined into the one project. We then posted the final project on GitHub so that we can make some edits.

The solution to the problem was easy for me to see because we had done something similar in class already. What I found to be more difficult was collaborating on it because each person in the team created a part of the final program and then we had to find a way to combine it. One problem that we ran into was that when different people contributed to one final project, the code ended up being not very neat because each person has their own coding style, and this was all combined together, so we had to find a way to fix that. The way we were able to efficiently collaborate was by using Github. This proved to be a challenge for the group because we were not familiar with it.

This project was exercise in how removing redundancies from the source code. We identified the repeating verses from the poem and assigned each member of the group with responsibility to code a method for that specific verse. The overall code was then put together by out team lead. This project was simple and with little complications. The team was very quick and efficient with producing the codes.
