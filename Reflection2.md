Our team began with the lead uploading files and instructions to Github, as we had established in project #1 we wanted to work on the project by sharing the platform. Following this setup stage, Lee sent an email to inform the team, and requested volunteers for a pseudocode rough draft to be written. Lee started writing the pseudocode in class, as we began collaborating. We discussed how the text was written, and how we needed to break down the solution. We concluded the program would need to run to return both a female name amount, and a male name amount. We also determined the best way to break down the search is to start by only reading the file which had the year the user declared. Cheyenne wrote a code to input the userâ€™s year into the file's name so that we searched the correct file, and we were left with our search method to construct. We discussed how we needed to search the list via line based processing, starting with "while.hasNextLine()". After this point, we all sought different ways to search through the list. A lot of methods were written, treating the file as an array, changing the "," to " " and searching via token-based processing, using Boolean systems, and lots of creative solutions were presented. What really helped in this stage was all the diverse ways the team wrote ways to catch user errors.
