Our team began with the lead uploading files and instructions to Github, as we had established in project #1 we wanted to work on the project by sharing the platform. Following this setup stage, Lee sent an email to inform the team, and requested volunteers for a pseudocode rough draft to be written. Lee started writing the pseudocode in class, as we began collaborating. We discussed how the text was written, and how we needed to break down the solution. We concluded the program would need to run to return both a female name amount, and a male name amount. We also determined the best way to break down the search is to start by only reading the file which had the year the user declared. Cheyenne wrote a code to input the userâ€™s year into the file's name so that we searched the correct file, and we were left with our search method to construct. We discussed how we needed to search the list via line based processing, starting with "while.hasNextLine()". After this point, we all sought different ways to search through the list. A lot of methods were written, treating the file as an array, changing the "," to " " and searching via token-based processing, using Boolean systems, and lots of creative solutions were presented. What really helped in this stage was all the diverse ways the team wrote ways to catch user errors. We then reviewed all the various suggested solutions together, and merged together the best of everyone's work and collaboration. Being on Github really help eveyone to collaborate on the project.

**Kat Chubarova**

I contributed some great psuedocode to this project, and helped by offering up new code solutions.

**Lee Janzen**

Most of what I did on this project was making Github a functional platform for the team. I created the new githubs for us all to edit, and put together spaces for testing, reflection, files, and final submital/editing. I submitted a few code solutions, and while the team liked them, we ultimatly prefered other solutions. At the begining I focused mostly on getting everyone on the team an opportunity to engage, and everyone really contributed. The code collaboration was amazing, and filled with creative solutions thanks to the diversity of the team, and the desire to contribute their own ideas. After ideas were submitted on a day I was not able to attend, we did a code review and picked out the best solutions from all the code proposed. I meshed some of these together for our final submital.

**Cheyenne Kosse**

Once we figured out the basics for what we wanted the program to do, I created a very simple solution. I created a program that looked for the given name in the files for the given year and returned how many females and males had that name. I put everything into the main method, so that we could split it up into more methods later. I put the basics down into our github so that it could be expanded on. Once everyone else figured out a solution or expanded on mine, we worked together as a group to figure out which solution we believed to be the best. 

**Abdalrahman Shaath**
My responsibilities in this team project where mainly organizing the code it into methods and general code organization. I also added a few strings for a more user-friendlier piece of code. I made the code more readable, not just for the user, but also for the programmer. My work was mainly organizing the code and making it more readable. Methods division was my main responsibility. I also did some de-bugging work.


**Ella Foley**

I combined the beginning code we had and fixed some bugs in it. I also made the output clearer for the user. My main contribution was creating ways to catch if the user entered something invalid. I made code that checked to see if the user entered a year that was not included in the files, and if this was the case, I prompted the user to enter a valid year. I also created code that would tell the user if the name they entered was not found in the year they gave. We decided to use the ideas behind this and parts of this code in the final submission.

**Ujal Alisker**

This project was little more difficult to divide it up to small parts for each individidual team members, thus we worked individually on it and brought our codes together. I started out by writing the code in a very primative way and worked my way out with little bugs here and there. The important bug to fix was one, where the code shouldnt crash if wrong year digit was entered and second, where the user gets to do unlimited searches up untill user decides to quit. Our team lead did a good job meshing the codes together and putting together the submiting project.
