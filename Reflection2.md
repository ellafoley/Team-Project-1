https://github.com/ellafoley/Team-Project-1

Our team began with the lead uploading files and instructions to Github, as we had established in project #1 we wanted to work on the project by sharing the platform. Following this setup stage, Lee sent an email to inform the team, and requested vollenteers for a pseudocode rough draft to be written.
